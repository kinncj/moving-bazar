Usage
===================

 Moving basar was developed to running in any shared hosting.
 
 This way, we do not use a database. All data is listed from text files.
 
 To start, take a look at products folter.
 
 Create a folder for each product that you want to list at website.
 
 In the product folder, we will have a text file (ini file) with some variables
 and a Picture.
 
 For example, we will create a Computer product.
 So, in the products folder, create a new folder called Computer.
 
 Inside this folder we will have an IMAGE file and a TEXT file.
 
 The Image file will be displayed at product lists and product details.
 
 For the text file, you can use this example above:
 
    name = Personal computer
    amount = 120.30
    quantity = 1
    description = Personal computer from unit test
  
 This way we will have a Computer product with "Personal Computer" name and another values that can be displayed at product details,
 like amount, quantity and description.
